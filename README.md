# scheduler

## Project Pitch

Our objective is to build a simple study application with various different features, of which some involve stretch goals. In the simplest form of the app, we want to build a scheduler that takes inputs from the user of events they have during the day as well as times for waking up and sleeping and outputs their schedule in a list form. The next prototype would take the list and output it in a calendar format, similar to the one on Google Calendar. Some further goals we want to achieve, if time allows, include creating different “types” of categories that our events would fall into and having a drop-down menu where we can select and filter out the events of our chosen “type”, implementing different study techniques and creating a study schedule for the user depending on when they’re busy and which study technique they chose, as well as asking the user to input what they hope to achieve during a study session and afterward how much they completed, and displaying this information to the user. We will be using Android Studio to develop our mobile app, which will mainly be written in Java. We may also utilize JavaScript for frontend implementation. One member has an Android device that we will hopefully be able to test on and, if not, we plan to use online Android emulators.
