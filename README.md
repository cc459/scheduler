# scheduler

## Project Pitch

In its simplest form, we want to build a scheduler that takes inputs from the user of events they have during the day as well as times for waking up and sleeping and outputs their schedule in a list form. The next prototype would take the list and output it in a calendar format, similar to the one on Google Calendar. Some further goals we want to achieve if time allows are creating different “types” of categories that our events would fall into and having a drop-down menu where we can select and filter out the events of our chosen “type”, implementing different study techniques and creating a study schedule for the user depending on when they’re busy and which study technique they chose, asking the user to input what they hope to achieve during a study session and afterward how much they completed, and displaying this information to the user. We will be using Android Studio to develop our mobile app which will mainly be written in Java (not sure if there will also be javascript, maybe this is will from the frontend/figma?). One member has an Android device that we will hopefully be able to test on and if not, we can also use online Android emulators.
